// 1. Explain an embedded system, its components, and its applications

// embedded system: specialized computer system designed to perform specific task within a larger system
// 3 main components:
// - microcontroller/microprocessor: the brain
// - memory: stores program instructions & data
// - I/O interfaces: connect to external world
// applications: everyday devices (washing machines, ovens, cars, industrial robots, IoT gadgets, etc)
// - note: it's essential for automation, control, & monitoring

// 2. Compare and contrast a CPU, an MCU, and an embedded system

// CPU (central processing unit): core component to execute instructions & calculations
// - examples: Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen 9, Apple M1, etc
// MCU (microcontroller unit): compact computing device that combines CPU, memory, & I/O peripherals on a single chip
// - typically used in embedded systems for specific tasks (sensors, controlling appliances)
// - examples: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32 MCU, etc
// embedded system: broad concept encompassing CPUs, MCUs, & software, all working together to perform dedicated functions
// - examples: smartphones, automotive engine control units (ECUs), smart home thermostats, etc

// 3. Explain the role of embedded systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the context of ubiquitous computing

// Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is a concept where computing technology is seamlessly integrated into our everyday surroundings
// - in this vision, computing becomes an invisible part of the environment, allowing people to interact with digital services effortlessly
// in IoT, embedded systems enable everyday objects to collect, process, and transmit data to internet, facilitating remote monitoring & control
// - this network of devices creates seamless web of information exchange, giving rise to ubiquitous computing, where computing capabilities serving as heart of the interconnected devices

// 4. Identify the challenges of incorporating embedded devices into IoT systems

// security: devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks
// scalability: concern when managing vast number of devices
// interoperability: diversity in hardware and communication protocols
// power efficiency: managing battery-powered device lifespans are vital
// data-related: privacy, regulations, and analysis of sheer volume of data
// regular software updates & maintenance

// 5. Explain the benefits of microcontroller-based embedded systems

// compact, cost-effective, power-efficient, ideal for applications with constrained resources
// real-time processing capabilities enable precise control & timing
// simplicity & ease of programming facilitate rapid development
// can be tailored to specific tasks, reducing unnecessary oerhead
// low power consumption, extends battery life in portable devices

// 6. Identify important trade-offs of embedded systems, such as cost and performance

// optimizing power efficiency might sacrifices processing speed/features
// achieving high performance requires more powerful hardware, which can increase manufacturing & development costs

// 7. Identify the characteristics of Arm architecture and processorsâ€¯as core embedded systems components for the IoT.

// known for low energy consumption, ideal for batteryAr-powered IoT devices
// the scalability allows IoT solutions to range from small, resource-constrained devices, to more powerful edge computing nodes
// Arm's widespread adoption & extensive ecosystem offer a wide variety of development tools, libraries, and support. enable rapid IoT product development
// it often integrate security features, crucial for IoT that transmit sensitive data

// X1. Technical Terminologies

// ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit (crucial part of CPU that performs calculations & logic operations)
// SoC: System on a Chip (mini-computer on a single chip that combines CPU, memory, I/O interfaces, sometimes graphic or networking components, etc)
// - commonly used in smartphones, IoT, to save space & power while providing necessary computing capabilities in 1 package
// - example: Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs (integrate CPU, GPU, modem, image signal processor (ISP), etc, onto a single chip)
// MCU: Microcontroller Unit
// CPU: Central Processing Unit
// IoT: Internet of Things

// X2. Look out!

// The complexity of the IoT, once you start digging deeper. Get the big picture, but then recognize that your expertise may develop in just one particular area.
// The complexity of the Arm product range. Again, get the big picture, but recognize that we focus on just one microcontroller type, and its support environment.
